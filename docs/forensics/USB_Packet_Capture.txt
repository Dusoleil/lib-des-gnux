Keyboards
=========

To disect what a keyboard was typing from a USB pcap file, refer to the
"Leftover Capture Data" (as Wireshark calls it).  This field will contain
bytes describing pressed keys (scancodes), including modifier keys.

At the time of writing this, my understanding of the data format is still a
little limited.  So, this is just what I know.  Update it, over time.

First byte of Leftover Data will contain any modifier keys.  I've seen 0x20 and
0x02 both mean Shift (perhaps one is left and one is right).

Starting 3 bytes in to the data (that is, offset 2), there will be codes for any
other pressed keys.  Their meanings are in the table below.  You may see multiple
bytes here.  As best I can tell, these are just multiple keys being pressed at
the same time.

Note that when keys are released, there will be a packet with zero bytes, which
tell the host that there are no keys being pressed.
