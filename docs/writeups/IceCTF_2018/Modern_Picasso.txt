"Here's a rendition of some modern digital abstract art. Is it more than art
though?"


Setup
-----
We are given the 'picasso.gif' file.  Initial static analysis showed no
recognizable strings nor any embedded file signatures in the file, so we moved
onto our next idea which was to analyze each frame of the gif.


Solution
--------
Opening the file in GIMP loads each frame as a layer in the image (thanks,
Dusoleil).  Each frame represents a portion of a still image, so we want to view
all of them at once.

For each frame (layer), add an alpha channel so that we can make the background
transparent.  Then use the magic wand to select the background and delete it.

The result is a single layer image which depicts the flag, along with some extra
colored boxes and a drawn in face.  See the 'picasso_solution.png' file.
