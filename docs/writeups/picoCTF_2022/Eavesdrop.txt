Packet Capture Contents
-----------------------
We receive a pcap file.  There is a bit of unrelated traffic, but two
conservations of interest:

    1) A plaintext chat conversation between two parties on port 9001:

        Hey, how do you decrypt this file again?
        You're serious?
        Yeah, I'm serious
        *sigh* openssl des3 -d -salt -in file.des3 -out file.txt -k supersecretpassword123
        Ok, great, thanks.
        Let's use Discord next time, it's more secure.
        C'mon, no one knows we use this program like this!
        Whatever.
        Hey.
        Yeah?
        Could you transfer the file to me again?
        Oh great. Ok, over 9002?
        Yeah, listening.
        Sent it
        Got it.
        You're unbelievable

    2) The transfer of the mentioned file, over port 9002:

        00000000  53 61 6c 74 65 64 5f 5f  03 a9 15 e7 2c 0f b7 5f   Salted__ ....,.._
        00000010  35 2a da 1e 07 31 57 0d  63 6c af 9b 67 ac 26 48   5*...1W. cl..g.&H

After saving the binary file contents to a local file, decrypt it using the
provided openssl command from the chat conservation.
